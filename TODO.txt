TODO List

replace getters/setters with unified 'borrow' convention,,, resist urge to rewrite codebase in rust (jk imagine (lol))

Camera Transformation.
Mouse Input.
World Axies.
Shape Factory.
Replace get/set with borrow.  // nah not that good
I need to look into GL_STATIC_DRAW vs GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW in Window.Rendering.cpp
Improve Mouse Want Capture ImGui // it might be all good actually

Wrap everything in a "Violet" namespace
Change double3 to Vec3d and float3 to Vec3f and float2 to Vec2f <- yes do this (prettier)

Add "project vector onto plane" members to Vector3d (would be useful for the camera controls I want)

This text doc should probably be a readme or something idk what im doing

bool showPanel = true; // Neat feature of ImGui
// inside loop:
if (showPanel) {
    ImGui::Begin("Left Panel", &showPanel, ImGuiWindowFlags_NoCollapse | ImGuiWindowFlags_NoResize);
    ImGui::End();
}
